# Honors Thesis / NMD 445 App Project

With this project, I am seeking to develop an app that serves as a public gallery of user submitted images trying to capture defined themes. I will also collect some basic demographic data from the users and add interactive sorting features, so maybe some trends will emerge in how different people approach the same theme!

I will continue developing this readme in the future to clarify the project more and add info on how to install and set up the project if you choose to do so.
